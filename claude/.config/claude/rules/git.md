# Git Workflow

## Pull Requests
- Always create PRs as draft
- Split commits by feature or logical unit
- Use conventional commit messages when appropriate
- Write commit messages in English

## Branch Strategy
- Create feature branches from main
- Branch naming: `<type>/<short-description>`
  - `feature/` for new features
  - `fix/` for bug fixes
  - `refactor/` for refactoring
  - `docs/` for documentation
